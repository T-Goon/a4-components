## TODO List

Heroku Link: https://a4-timothy-goon.herokuapp.com/

This is a TODO list web app that allows for the creation and management of a todo list. Users can create accounts directly on the app or use a Github account login. Compared to a3 all the functionality of the app is exactly the same. In terms of the development experience I feel that converting an app into React took a ton of work. The development setup I used where the client was run using `react-scripts start` made it so that there were a lot of small gotachs I had to work around because the development client and server were served from two different ports. To that end I had to more or less refactor my entire app to get everything to work correctly. If I was developing the app from scratch I think the experience would be better than in a3 since I wouldn't have to do any manual DOM manipulation.
